          <h2>Essay About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a curious person. I have always been and always will be. I have many examples of my curiosity; I could fill 100 pages with my stories. I will spare you the reading and only give you three. Two stories from when I was a child and one fairly recent. Curiosity is good because even if you get hurt it can tell you more about yourself.</p>
          <p>Curiosity is good, because it can show you your interests. My first example is from when I was a childâ€¦ well a younger child. My family and I used to go to this small rock beach. One day when we were at the beach there was a water snake swimming near the dock. I, being the smart and reasonable child that I am, picked it up. It slithered across my arm, its skin was scaly, almost alien. Then it bit me, right on my middle finger (don't worry this water snake was not poisonous). It was actually great because if someone ever asked where I got bit I could just give them the birdy and not get in trouble. This is clearly an example of me being curious because I wanted to get a close look at the snake. I still pick up snakes but now with a net because my curiosity showed me something: I am interested in snakes.</p>
  	      <p>One other reason why curiosity is good is because it can show you traits about yourself. I am a quick thinker. When I was five or six, I was with my family at our country house in upstate New York where we go every weekend. I was walking behind my house and I saw a hole. I did what any person would do. I took a stick an shoved in the hole. Turns out the hole was the location of a bee hive. After I took out the stick I heard a loud buzzing coming getting louder and louder. I ran away as a gigantic black buzzing swarm came out of the hole. The swarm chased after me with bloodthirst. I ran straight into my house and slammed the door. Then I heard hundreds of thumps on the door. Obviously I had not gotten out unscathed. I had many stings along my body. So this is clearly an example of my curiosity because I wanted to see what was in that hole and it led me to find out that I am a quick thinker.</p>
  	      <p>My curiosity also taught me how fun the outdoors is for me. During last winter I went hiking with my family. It was very cold the night before and also on this day, so there was lots of ice. While we were hiking I saw a moderate decline, so I did the smart thing. I cracked a slab of ice, held on to each end, and slid down. My plan was to build speed with the ice and then let go while stopping my movement to watch it slide down by itself. However stopping didn't work. Thankfully there was a conveniently placed tree to hit me and save me from furter physical damage. This is another example of my curiosity because I wanted to see how slippery the ice was and I found out it was sufficiently slippery. This taught me how fun the outdoors can be for me because near death experiences are fun.</p>
        	<p>All in all I am a very curious child and sometimes that is harmful, but I always learn something about myself from my curiosity. I have enjoyed every single one of my experiences being a curious child, like the time with the water snake, the time with the icy mountain, and the time with the beehive. So you now know that I am a very curious child and sometimes I pay the price for that but, I would never give up being curious.</p>
